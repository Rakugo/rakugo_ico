  const startBlock = web3.eth.blockNumber + 2 // blockchain block number where the crowdsale will commence. Here I just taking the current block that the contract and setting that the crowdsale starts two block after
  const endBlock = startBlock + 300  // blockchain block number where it will end. 300 is little over an hour.
  const rate = new web3.BigNumber(1200) // rate of ether to Gustavo Coin in wei
  const wallet = web3.eth.accounts[0] // the address that will hold the fund. Recommended to use a multisig one for security.
